Tools for manipulating urls

## Code Style
To keep a consistant coding style in the project, we're going with [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) for JS and [Polar Mobile's guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide) for CoffeeScript. Both of these are pretty standard guides. For documenting in the code, we're using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).
